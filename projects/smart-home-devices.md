# Smart Home Device Security System Analysis

**Role:** Security Analyst (Student Team Project)  
**Skills:** Research, Independent Work, Security Frameworks and Regulatory Compliance (OWASP, NIST, GDPR, PIPEDA)  
**Timeline:** January 2025 - February 2025

## üîç Project Overview
The main goal for the project is to design and implement a robust cybersecurity system for Door Face Panels. An energized door with interchangeable panels that carry SMART devices inside. Facial/voice recognition, NFC/RFID are selected technologies for The Door face systems. 
This will involve conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats to the smart door system.
Our team explored system-level vulnerabilities and compliance risks in smart data processing, including facial recognition and encrypted data flows. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Did
- Conducted research on secure design practices, OWASP Top 10, and NIST guidelines
- Assessed GDPR, ISO, and PIPEDA compliance in data collection and storage
- Proposed technical improvements for encryption, system access controls, and privacy

## üìù Outcome
- Delivered a comprehensive technical report with risk analysis and design recommendations
- Presented findings to stakeholders and received strong feedback on clarity and depth

## Feedback

"I am writing to enthusiastically endorse Jean Carla Romin for her outstanding work on a facial recognition and image analysis project for our startup, The Door Face Panel. Jean Carla's contributions have been invaluable to our development process, and her project has significantly advanced our understanding of the complexities and opportunities within this field. Jean Carla's project was comprehensive and insightful, covering crucial aspects of facial recognition and image analysis as they relate to smart door technology. I was particularly impressed with her ability to not only develop technical solutions but also to thoroughly address the critical legal and ethical considerations. Her work included a detailed examination of relevant remedies, standards, and legislation, demonstrating a strong understanding of the regulatory landscape surrounding this technology. Furthermore, the inclusion of practical examples brought her research to life and provided us with concrete applications of her findings. Throughout the project, Jean Carla displayed a high level of professionalism, dedication, and technical expertise. She was proactive in her research, consistently met deadlines, and communicated her progress effectively. She also demonstrated a remarkable ability to synthesize complex information and present it in a clear and concise manner. Jean Carla's project has provided The Door Face Panel with a solid foundation upon which to build our smart door technology. Her insights into the technical, legal, and ethical aspects of facial recognition have been essential in guiding our development strategy. I am confident that her skills and expertise would be a valuable asset to any organization. I highly recommend Jean Carla Romin without reservation. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions."

"Jean has done an amazing job describing the pros and cons of image processing technologies used in the current market. Inclusion of standards and privacy legislation in different jurisdictions is also quite valuable for initial system design and launch location considerations. Remedies and encryption methods are straight to the point and applicable during the design $ operation phases. Overall one of the best projects we've received so far."
