# Smart Home Device Security System Analysis

**Role:** Security Analyst (Student Team Project)  
**Skills:** Research, Independent Work, Security Frameworks and Regulatory Compliance (OWASP, NIST, GDPR, PIPEDA)  
**Timeline:** January 2025 - February 2025

## üîç Project Overview
The main goal for the project is to design and implement a robust cybersecurity system for Door Face Panels. An energized door with interchangeable panels that carry SMART devices inside. Facial/voice recognition, NFC/RFID are selected technologies for The Door face systems. 
This will involve conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats to the smart door system.
Our team explored system-level vulnerabilities and compliance risks in smart data processing, including facial recognition and encrypted data flows. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Did
- Conducted research on secure design practices, OWASP Top 10, and NIST guidelines
- Assessed GDPR, ISO, and PIPEDA compliance in data collection and storage
- Proposed technical improvements for encryption, system access controls, and privacy

## üìù Outcome
- Delivered a comprehensive technical report with risk analysis and design recommendations
- Presented findings to stakeholders and received strong feedback on clarity and depth
