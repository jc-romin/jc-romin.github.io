# Hi, I'm Carla ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent BSc Mathematics graduate from the University of Calgary, with a concentration in Statistics and a growing passion for **cybersecurity**, **cloud computing**, and **data analysis**.

Iâ€™ve earned certifications from AWS, Microsoft, Google, and ISC2, and recently completed client-based security and cloud architecture projects.  

I'm skilled in Python, SQL, R, Bash, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.

I also enjoy turning data into insights using Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.

I'm actively seeking entry-level roles in **cybersecurity**, **cloud infrastructure**, or **data analytics**, where I can grow, contribute, and continue learning.
